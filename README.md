Manim Engine Claude is a notebook detailing the step by step process of using Claude-Opus to generate cool visualizations, similiar to those of the beloved youtube channel 3Blue1Brown. All installation steps are provided in the notebook. Feel free to follow along in the notebook so that you yourself generate this final visualization:

By following the workflow outlined in the Notebook you are truly only limited to your creativity. For some inspiration, I have added a couple more examples of more complicated visualizations I have created using this same work flow!

A demo video on how to pass images into Claude. The Juypter Notebook provided by the Anthropic-Cookbook was given as input. That notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/multimodal/getting_started_with_vision.ipynb).
